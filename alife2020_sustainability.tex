\begin{abstract}
Systems of coupled elements, with dynamics governed by cubic
differential equations, have been established as simple and powerful
models to study sustainability. Here we combine such systems with an
agent which impacts upon the system. This enables characterising
sustainability as empowerment, a property emerging from the
interaction between the agent and the ecological systems sustaining
it. We present initial results illustrating the effects of dynamical
properties of the system affect on empowerment, and thereby
potentially on sustainability.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}

Sustainability is widely recognised as a central concept that should
underpin decisions and policies, aiming to ensure continued survival,
welfare and prosperity of humankind. In some contrast to its perceived
importance, a rigorous and generally applicable definition of
sustainability continues to prove elusive. Some approaches to define
sustainability, such as the Brundtland definition
\citep{Brundlandcommission1987}, are frequently invoked in the context
of considering Earth as it is, but have not been formalised to enable
their application to other systems, such as Artificial Life models.
More formal approaches to sustainability often focus on stability.
While stability of the sustaining environment (e.g.\ the planet with
its ecological and abiotic systems) is necessary for
sustainability, focusing on it alone excludes the active role of the
entity seeking to be sustained (e.g.\ humankind).

We have previously adapted \emph{empowerment}, an
information-theoretic quantity measuring the future potentialities
that an agent can invoke to characterise sustainability for an agent
inside a given environment \citep{Kim2009_sustainability}. In that
work, empowerment was constrained to only include potentialities when
their effect could be reversed, as a measure for active reversibility
of the agent's environmental exploits. We now modify this idea. We
adapt the concept of tipping elements, introduced in
\citep{Lenton2008_tippingelements}. These are models for ``tipping''
dynamics where a desired locally stable state can be perturbed strongly
enough to move into an undesired stable state.  Bi-stable differential
equations have been used to formally model tipping elements, and these
have been used as building blocks to model and study complex systems
comprised of multiple interacting tipping elements
\citep{Brummitt2015_coupledcatastrophes,Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}.
We show how to combine the empowerment with the tipping element
formalism to offer a framework to model how well an agent can drive a
system ``gone bad'' into its desired state.

% sustainability, but so far the agent to be sustained has not been

\subsection{Additional Introductory Notes}

Cubic differential equations are a simple (arguably the simplest)
systems for studying tipping processes. There always is at least one
stable fixed point, i.e.\ one root of the differential equation where
the first derivative is negative, and if the effective intercept is
within a suitable range, two stable fixed points exist, thus enabling
the system to be in two alternative states.


\section{System}

The design of the environment component in our system generally
follows that of \citet{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}. It consists of
tipping elements, each of which is modelled by a cubic differential equation of the
form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_cubic}
  \frac{dx}{dt} = ax - bx^3 + c
\end{equation}
As \citet{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}, we restrict
ourselves to $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.

The state of a system of $n$ interacting tipping elements is a vector
$\vectorsym{x} = [x_1, \ldots, x_n]^T$ whose interaction
is  modelled by
 a coupling function $C_i(\vectorsym{x})$
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_coupled}
  \frac{dx_i}{dt} = ax_i - bx_i^3 + c_i + C_i(\vectorsym{x})\;.
\end{equation}
Following \citet{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}, we use coupling
functions
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_couplingfunction}
  C_i(\vectorsym{x}) = \sum_j d_{ji} x_j
\end{equation}
but unlike their work, we require $d_{ji} = 0$ if $j \ge i$,
i.e.\ $(d_{ij})$ to be a lower triangular matrix. This restriction
ensures that, for coupled tipping elements, their bi-stable character
is preserved (bi-directional interactions between tipping elements can
result in global dynamical features that amount to a qualitative
departure from the ``tipping point'' system characteristics, such as
cyclic attractors). Thus the graph of interactions becomes a directed
acyclic graph, in which we can arrange the components in order, so
that the steady state of component $x_i$ depends only on higher-ranked
components $x_1, \ldots x_{i-1}$, enabling efficient computation of
fixed points of the system. This models an interrelated, but
hierarchical ``ecosystem'' with different levels of importance for the
subsystems.  Model now the additional effect of the agent
(``humanity'') on its environment by the totality of the terms
$\agentimpact_i(t)$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq_coupledwithagent}
  \frac{dx_i}{dt} = ax_i - bx_i^3 + c_i + C_i(\vectorsym{x}) + \agentimpact_i(t)
\end{equation}
This affects the rate of change in the $x_i$; examples would be modelling
emissions of carbon dioxide, release of nutrients
(e.g.\ phosphates), or removal of biomass (harvesting).



\section{Combined Framework}
We present now the core framework.
An individual ``cubic tipping element'' as defined by
Eq.~\ref{eq_cubic} has one or two stable fixed points. In the simple
special case of $c = 0$, there are two stable fixed points which can
be straightforwardly found as $x_{-} = -1$ and $x_{+} = 1$,
\citet{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements} refer to these as the
``normal'' and the ``tipped'' state, respectively. The third, unstable
fixed point at $x_{\mathrm{unstable}} = 0$ is not important for the
work presented here.

Extrema of Eq.~\ref{eq_cubic} are located at
$\pm \xextremum = \pm 1 / \sqrt{3}$. Again considering $c = 0$, the
rate of change at these extrema evaluates to
$\pm d\xextremum / dt = \pm \ccrit = \pm 2 / 3\sqrt{3} \approx \pm
0.38$.
The condition for an individual tipping element to have two stable
fixed points can thus be stated more precisely as
$-\ccrit < c < \ccrit$. This condition generalises to
$-\ccrit < c + C_i(\vectorsym{x}) + \agentimpact_i < \ccrit$ for a
tipping element $i$ in a system of coupled elements subject to impacts
by the agent.

To compute empowerment in the tipping scenario, we determine the
potential stable points that can be ``intentionally'' induced by the
agent. We discretise the state of the environment by distinguishing
only the two stable states $x_{i+}$ and $x_{i-}$ for each element $i$,
i.e.\ a total of $2^n$ states of interest. As in
\citep{Kim2009_sustainability}, we assume no noise in the agent
sensing and actuation. Empowerment is thus determined by the number of
states which the agent can reach by applying its actuators
$\agentimpact_i$.

We use stable fixed points of the environment on its own, i.e.\ of
Eq.~\ref{eq_coupled} as starting points for which we characterise
empowerment, and allow the agent to impact the environment by choosing
to set $\agentimpact_i$ to $-E$, $0$ or $E$, where $E$ is a parameter
setting the strength of the impact, or control, of the agent on the
environment.

If these controls were applied permanently and sufficiently large,
e.g. $E \gg \ccrit + \max_i C_i$, the agent could directly dial the
state of each component, and consequently its empowerment would take
the maximal value of $n$ bits. At the other extreme, setting $E = 0$
would prevent the agent from having any impact on the environment and
its empowerment would vanish in all states.

A crucial concern in sustainability, and about tipping points
specifically, is that human impacts could result in changes to the
environment that are permanent, i.e.\ that stopping an impact may not
be sufficient to restore the environment to its ``normal'' state.
Therefore, we only want to count state changes that persist when the
direct control of the agent is removed. We implement this by letting
the agent apply its impact for a limited time only, which is followed
by a relaxation period during which the environment evolves on its own
and converges towards one of its fixed points. We use the state found
at the end of this relaxation period to quantify empowerment.


In previous work, e.g.\ \cite{Salge2014_empowermentintro}
the agent's reach is typically restricted by a time horizon for its actions. Here, instead, we will explore empowerment as a function of limits on
$\agentimpact_i$, i.e.\ the strength of  effect that the
agent can exert on tipping elements $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$.


\section{Implementation}

The software for the analyses presented here was written in R 3.4.4
\citep{RManual2018} and requires the \texttt{deSolve} package for
solving Eq.~\ref{eq_coupled} and
Eq.~\ref{eq_coupledwithagent} using Runge-Kutta 4th order integration.
The code is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/jttkim/al20sustain}.


\section{Results}

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{empprof05s.eps}

    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{empprof05l.eps}
    \caption{Empowerment as a function of $E$, the impact that the
      agent can exert on element $i$, for the state with most elements
      at $x_{i-}$. Results are shown for a system with weaker coupling
      $d_{ji} \in [-0.2, 0.2]$ (upper panel) and one with stronger
      coupling $d_{ji} \in [-0.8, 0.8]$ (lower panel).}
    \label{fig_empowermentprofiles}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
We generated the variable parameters $c_i$ and the lower triangle of
$(d_{ji})$ by drawing from uniform distributions. The values of $c_i$
were drawn from $[-0.1, 1]$, and we created an environment with weaker
coupling constants $d_{ji} \in [-0.2, 0.2]$ and one with stronger
coupling constants $d_{ji} \in [-0.8, 2=0.8]$.

Fig.~\ref{fig_empowermentprofiles} shows profiles of empowerment as a
function of $E$, the agent's potential impact on the environment's
tipping elements. At $E = 0$, empowerment is $0$ as the agent is
unable to make any change to the stable state of the environment.
Fig~\ref{fig_empowermentprofiles} shows results for the ``normal''
stable state in which most elements are at $x_{i-}$. Given to the
symmetric method of generating our system's parameters, this
``normal'' is representative for the states of the system in general.

At $E = 0$ the agent has no empowerment, as explained above, and this
extends into small nonzero values of $E$. This is because for an
element in the ``normal'' stable state $x_{i-}$, it is necessary that
$E > \ccrit + C_i$ for the agent to put the element into the
``tipped'' state $x_{i+}$. This explains the emergence of nonzero
empowerment around $E = \ccrit$. Such shifts are somewhat easier with
weaker coupling, which is reflected by the onset of empowerment at
slightly lower $E$.

It is also noticeable from Fig.~\ref{fig_empowermentprofiles} that
weaker coupling enables the agent to attain higher empowerment. One
reason for this is that the number of stable states is maximal in
systems with no coupling at all. In this special case, each element
can be set to each of its two states, independently of all other
elements. At the other end of the scale, a strong interaction from an
upstream element $j$, say with $d_{ji} x_j > \ccrit$, increases the
chance that element $i$ has only one stable state altogether. As a
result, the number of stable system states decreases as the range of
randomly generated $d_{ji}$ increases, explaining also the lower
plateau in empowerment seen with strong coupling.


\section{Discussion and Outlook}

% This deficiency has long been an impediment to public discourse
% \citep{Kim2001_plantbiodiversity}.

We have introduced systems comprised of coupled tipping elements
affected by an agent as a model to study sustainability and to
quantify it using the principled concept of empowerment
\citep{Salge2014_empowermentintro}, rooted in information theory
\citep{CoverThomas1991_informationtheory}. The cubic differential
equation systems, which we use here, capture essential aspects of
sustainability have been applied in sustainability research and
beyond, as reviewed e.g.\ by
\citet{Klose2019_interactingtippingelements}. By including an agent,
our system opens up opportunities to model sustainability as a
property that emerges as an agent interacts with a system. This allows
for a more precise characterisation and formalisation of
sustainability, separating it from more general systems stability,
such as ecosystem stability.

Our plans to further develop this approach include studying the
effects of providing the agent with different actuation channels. An
alternative to allowing the agent to impact all elements equally is to
restrict the agent to impact only one system directly. In this
scenario, high levels of empowerment result if the agent is able to
affect a large number of elements indirectly via their coupling. We
therefore anticipate that stronger coupling will increase, rather than
decrease, empowerment. It will be interesting to investigate whether
susceptibility to ``domino effects'' between elements can be
characterised in this way, and specifically systems in which an
element can cause a downstream element to tip, as described by
\citet{Brummitt2015_coupledcatastrophes}.

Empowerment in its general form considers an agent to receive signals
from the environment, and to send signals to the environment through
its actuators. Both sensors and actuators can be affected by noise. As
humankind, we have only partial and noisy data from our environment,
and our control over our action at a population or society level is
imperfect as well. Therefore, it is important to understand the impact
of these imperfections on sustainability.


% TODO discuss asymmetry
% Shifting the offset c in a tipping unit permits producing a
% hysteresis which makes it easier (for the agent) to "tip" the system
% into the other stable state, while the reverse operation becomes
% more difficult.

It is interesting to note that the offset $c$ produces a hysteresis
which makes it easier(for the agent to tip the system in one direction
(from $x_{-}$ to $x_{+}$ if $c > 0$) while the reverse operation
becomes more difficult. This enables applying the concept of
sustainable empowerment, which we introduced in
\citet{Kim2009_sustainability}, to systems of coupled tipping elements
as well.

Finally, a strength of our model is that it allows efficient
computation of fixed point as well as integrating differential
equations to produce time series. This opens perspectives to
investigate the potential of investigating the use of time series for
characterising and quantifying sustainability, e.g.\ as a tool to
identify risks of breakdowns in sustainability or to identify elements
that are especially relevant to maintaining sustainability.

% From perspective for the work presented here include

% proof-of-concept framework to study the effect of reversible,
